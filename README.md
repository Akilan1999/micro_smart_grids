# micro_smart_grids

Repository with Smart Grid simulation code from MATLAB and Simulink along with a report on the Simulation of a Smart Grid at a microgrid level.


## Getting Started

Before running the validation case or the experimental simulation, it is necessary to load the [default MATLAB solar panel data](Simulation/default_PV_data.mat) in the MATLAB workspace. The simulations also require the download of the [Simscape package](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simscape.html).


## Validation case



## Simulation

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system


## Built With

* [MATLAB](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html?s_tid=hp_products_matlab) - Programing language employed
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Used to build the grids
