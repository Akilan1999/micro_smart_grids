# micro_smart_grids

Repository with Smart Grid simulation code from MATLAB and Simulink along with a report on the Simulation of a Smart Grid at a microgrid level.

## Getting Started

Before running the validation case or the experimental simulation, it is necessary to load the [default MATLAB solar panel data](Simulation/default_PV_data.mat) in the MATLAB workspace. The simulations also require the download of the [Simscape package](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simscape.html).

## Validation case

To run the theoretical validation case, the [validation simulation grid](Analytic Validation/power_microgrid_v3_analytic.slx) should then be opened in MATLAB Simulink and run over a 24h period. The output results from the scopes should then be compared to the output of the [validation script](Analytic Validation/FYP_analytical_test.m).
